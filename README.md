# 👋 Hi, I’m Saumya  

💻 **Graduate CS @ UMass Amherst** | Ex-**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure** | **Budding Open-Source Contributor**  

I’m a software engineer passionate about **building systems that scale** and crafting solutions that feel seamless for end users.  
At **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**, I spent 3 years working on **high-availability and replication systems** for HeatWave MySQL Database Service — optimizing performance, reliability, and fault tolerance in distributed environments.  

Since starting my master's, I’ve been diving deeper into:  
- **Distributed Systems** — secure, fault-tolerant architectures  
- **System Design & APIs** — designing for scalability & maintainability  
- **Open Source Development** — contributing to projects like **Apache Iceberg**, **Reflect Diary**, and **Codecademy Docs**  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:  
- 🍳 Meal-prepping something wholesome  
- 🌱 Learning something completely new (currently exploring low-level design in Java)  
- 🌏 Connecting with people & exchanging ideas
